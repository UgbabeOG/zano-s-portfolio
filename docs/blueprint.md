## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft gray (#808080) to highlight the vibrancy of the displayed media. The neutral primary allows the visuals to dominate without distraction.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0). This near-white background keeps the interface airy and uncluttered, complementing the soft gray.
- Accent color: Muted yellow. Selected to draw attention without overwhelming, providing a subtle contrast that still harmonizes within the neutral palette.
- Clean, readable sans-serif font for descriptions and titles.
- Minimalist icons for categories and navigation.
